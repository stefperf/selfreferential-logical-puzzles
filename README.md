# Selfreferential logical puzzles


PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
--------------------
Functionalities for logical puzzles made up of collectively self-referential questions (as in the below example):
- Logical representation
- Brute-force solution
- Automated search for a puzzle having the desired characteristics: types and nr. of questions, nr. of possible answers for each question, nr. of solutions (without validating beforehand whether it is feasible to create a puzzle with the chosen set of characteristics)

Developed in Python 3.9.1.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
-----------------
Many thanks to my colleague Heidi Pang, because during our free time, she inspired this project by posing the sample puzzle, co-authored with me an earlier version of this code in pair programming and, last but not least, managed to teach me something I did not know about Python.
It is great to have colleagues like her, always pushing me to improve!
