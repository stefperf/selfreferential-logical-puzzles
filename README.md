# Heidi's puzzle


PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
--------------------
Functionalities for for logical puzzles made up of collectively self-referential questions (as in the below example):
- Logical representation
- Brute-force solution
- Automated search for a puzzle having the desired characteristics: types and nr. of questions, nr. of possible answers for each question, nr. of solutions (without validating beforehand whether it is feasible to create a puzzle with the chosen set of characteristics)

Developed in Python 3.9.1.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
-----------------
Many thanks to my colleague Heidi Pang, because during our free time, she inspired this project by posing the sample puzzle, co-authored an earlier version of this code and, last but not least, managed to teach me something I did not know about Python.
It is great to have colleagues like her, always pushing me to improve!


PUZZLE EXAMPLE, WITH SOLUTION:
------------------------------
LOGICAL PUZZLE MADE UP BY COLLECTIVELY SELF-REFERENTIAL QUESTIONS

1. The first question with B as the correct answer is:

3. The answer to Question 1 is:

    A. D     B. C     C. A     D. B

4. The number of questions which have D as the correct answer is:

    A. 3     B. 2     C. 1     D. 0

5. The number of questions which have B as the correct answer is:

    A. 0     B. 2     C. 3     D. 1

SOLUTION(S)

--- List of all possible sequences of answers: ---

    1. C,    2. D,    3. B,    4. C,    5. B
